# Handwritten-digit-recognition-using-CNN

A handwritten digit recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Using this, users can leverage the power of deep learning, particularly CNN architectures, for accurate and efficient recognition of handwritten digits from images. It includes data preprocessing scripts, CNN model architectures, and evaluation metrics tailored specifically for digit recognition tasks. The model is trained using mnsit dataset with functionalities such as user input where user can upload an image of any digit which can be recognised by the model.
